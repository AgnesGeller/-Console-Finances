# Console-Finances

My first project using JavaScript. This JavaScript code analyzes the financial records of a company. It calculates various metrics such as the number of months in the dataset, net profit and losses, average changes in profit and losses, tracks the total change in profit month to month, and determines the greatest increase in profit and losses.

## Tasks Requirements

I have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.
My task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset.
The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
I need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.
(Total/(Number of months - 1))
The greatest increase in profits (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
The greatest decrease in losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
When I open my code in the browser  resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average Change: -2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
